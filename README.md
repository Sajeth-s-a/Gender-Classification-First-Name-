# Gender-Classification-First-Name-

Deep Learning project to classify **gender on the basis of first names** using LSTM. Achieved a validation accuracy of 83.43% on validation dataset.

### LSTM 
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture[1] used in the field of deep learning (DL). Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition  and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDSs (intrusion detection systems).
